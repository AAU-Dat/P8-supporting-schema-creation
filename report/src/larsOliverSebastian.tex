This paper investegates the application of analysing an abstract database schema in conjunction with a program, to check if some properties of the two are upheld. By using LTL properties and lattice theory, converting programs to graphs , and an abstract syntax, the database schema and program can be analysed 


\begin {abstract}     Papers like\cite{halder_abstract_2012} have shown that abstract interpretation can be used to analyze the behavior of database queries.     Some of the issues that are found in some of these already existing papers are failure to terminate, or the analysis is not precise enough.     This paper presents a novel approach to the abstract interpretation of database queries.     The abstract interpretation is based on the abstract semantics of the database queries, which are defined in terms of abstract domains.     The abstract domains are used to represent the possible values of the database queries, and the abstract interpretation is used to analyze the possible behaviors of the database queries.     This paper also presents a new way of representing strings in the form af regular expressions, which allows for a more precise analysis of the database queries, as well as integer values represented as intervals.     \end{abstract}
