\section{Converting Code Program Graph}
The step of creating a program graph from the code (also called the program), is already a proven concept, therefore this paper will not delve into the details, but rather simply inform the reader.
The book used to show that the concept of creating a program graph from code is a proven concept is \cite{nielson_formal_2019}, specifically chapter 2.2.
The program graph is a graph that represents the code in a way that is easier to analyze.
A program graph consists of a finite set of nodes, an initial node and final node, a set of actions, and a finite set of actions.
