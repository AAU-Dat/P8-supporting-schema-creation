\todo[inline]{Casper says: The seminal work of \cite{cousot_abstract_1977} should also be mentioned here.}

\todo[inline]{Casper says: \cite{cousot_abstract_1996} should also be mentioned here, and maybe the fact that we try to \emph{implement} some of the ideas mentioned namely regular expressions as abstract domains and kindof linear inequalities and in that regard we should mention \cite{li2010abstract}.}

This paper builds on work of abstract interpretation of database queries by Cortesi and Halder~\cite{halder_abstract_2012}.
Concretely, we use their work for analysing a database schema in relation to a program using the syntax they describe.\todo[inline]{Casper says: the Related Works section should also give  brief outline of their contribution.}


Additionally, we use LTL as described in X, Y, and Z to describe properties to check against.\todo{Casper says: not anymore}
