\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
With the framework for the abstract interpretation of databases from~\cite{halder_abstract_2012} as a starting point, we have further developed their work to try and improve some of the areas where the original framework was lacking.

Our semantics is based on the abstract interpretation of the paper though the size of both the syntax and semantics has been reduced.
The original framework would run indefinitely in some cases, which is not desirable.
We have modified their framework for use in our analysis to ensure termination.

When discussing the soundness of our analysis, we have provided a proof sketch, to back up our claim that the analysis is sound.
We have not proved it rigorously, but we believe that such a proof is possible.

For the above reasons wgit e think that our analysis is a good starting point for further development and research, to see if it can be used to verify properties of databases in the future.
Or to see if this can be implemented in a tool that can be used to verify properties of databases.
