\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We have provided an improved language for the abstract interpretation of databases from \cite{halder_abstract_2012} and shown that the improved interpretation is always sound.
Our semantics is based on the abstract interpretation of the paper, and we have shown that the abstract interpretation of the relational algebra is sound.

The improved language is sound; however, its expressibility has been reduced compared to its predecessor, as it will always terminate.
This is because the improved language is more restrictive than the original language.
This limitation particularly arises when inserting a table as a field into another table.

Our study focuses on leveraging abstract interpretation to verify database properties across abstract states, ensuring the validity of properties across all conceivable concrete states.
