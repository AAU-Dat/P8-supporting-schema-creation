\section{Examples}\label{sec:example}
In this section we will give three examples of our analysis on three different programs.
First we provide a large example showing some possible queries that could be answered by the analysis and how the analysis would be carried out.
Thereafter we provide the analysis of the program discussed in the introduction, as expected the analysis terminates.
As it turns out, the cover lattices are superfluous in the first two example.
More specifically if we let $\lookupcl(v) = \regexs_{\infty}$ or $\lookupcl(v) = \uints_{\infty}$ depending on the type of $v$, where $\regexs_{\infty}$ and $\uints_{\infty}$ is $\regexs$ and $\uints$ where transfinite union and intersection is allowed, respectively.
For the sake of simplicity we assume the prequel in those respective examples.
Therefore the last examples is one where the cover lattice is needed.
In this is example we first show that the analysis does not terminate without the cover lattice, and then we show that it terminates with the cover lattice.
