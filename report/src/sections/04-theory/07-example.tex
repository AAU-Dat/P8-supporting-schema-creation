\section{Examples}\label{sec:example}
This section will give three examples of our analysis of three different programs.
First, we provide a large example showing some possible program properties the analysis could answer and how it would be carried out.

After that, we provide the analysis of the program discussed in the introduction; as expected, the analysis terminates.
As it turns out, the cover lattices are superfluous in the first two examples.
More specifically if we let $\lookupcl(v) = \regexs_{\infty}$ or $\lookupcl(v) = \uints_{\infty}$ depending on the type of $v$, where $\regexs_{\infty}$ and $\uints_{\infty}$ is $\regexs$ and $\uints$ where transfinite union and intersection is allowed, respectively, the first two examples terminate.

For the sake of simplicity we assume the prequel in those respective examples.
Therefore, the last example is one where the cover lattice is needed.
In this example, we first show that the analysis does not terminate without the cover lattice and then show that it terminates with the cover lattice.
