\section{Future Works}\label{sec:future-works}
This sections presents some ideas for future works that could be pursued to extend the results of this paper.
Some of the areas explored in this paper could be further developed.
One of these areas is the use of abstract interpretation in regard to numbers.
Numbers can come in a few different type when dealing with databases.

Currently, this paper only shows the theoretical approach to this problem therefore one of the future works could be to implement the abstract semantics in a program that could be used to analyze a database system and check for some requested properties.
For such a program to be made a lot of work would be needed to implement the abstract interpretation and the semantics in a way that would be able to analyze a general database system with some of the restrictions there are in the current state of the theory.
There would also need to be either a language on which you would apply this program or there would need to be made a written syntax for the current version as well.

As it stands now, the abstract interpretation is only aimed at PostgreSQL databases, so one of the future projects could be to extended it to other database systems such as MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server, to cover a wider range of database systems.

Finally, the abstract interpretation could be extended to cover more complex queries, such as queries that involve multiple tables or queries that involve subqueries.
