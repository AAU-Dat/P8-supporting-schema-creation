\section{Future Works}\label{sec:future-works}
This sections presents some ideas for future works that could be pursued to extend the results of this paper.
Some of the areas explored in this paper could be further developed.
One of these areas is the use of abstract interpretation in regard to numbers.
Numbers can come in a few different type when dealing with databases.
As of the current implementation, the abstract interpretation is limited to integers, therefore one of the improvements that could be made is to extend the abstract interpretation to support floating point numbers.
The extension of the abstract interpretation to support floating point numbers would allow for a more precise analysis of the database queries.
One of the obstacles to this extension is the fact that floating point numbers are represented in a different ways in different programming languages, which makes it difficult to create a general abstract interpretation for floating point numbers.

Another area that could be further developed is the precision of the semantic in som cases.
The current set of semantics are very similar to the ones fund in the original paper by Halder and Cortesi~\cite{halder_abstract_2012}, and they are not very precise.
This could then lead to a more precise analysis of the database area and more accurate results when judging the abstract interpretation of the database.

Currently, this paper only shows the theoretical approach to this problem therefore one of the future works could be to implement the abstract semantics in a program that could be used to analyze a database system and check for some requested properties.
