\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}


\paragraph{Objective}

The objective of this work is to develop a general software tool, utilizing abstract interpretation for analyzing the reachable state space of a entity relation database given its schema, accompanying reactive procedures and a model of the behavior of the environment in which the database will reside.

\todo[inline]{Maybe we can use workflow nets for the environment behavior model.}

\paragraph{Justification}

It seems that no general tool has been developed.

\paragraph{Background}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cousot 'invented' abstract interpretation.
    \item Halder and Cortesi extended abstract interpretation to query languages.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Guidance to the reader}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The reader should have a basic understanding of SQL.
    \item The reader should understand abstract interpretation and whatever semantics we are using.
    \item The reader should understand that a main contribution is the introduction of an environment behavior model.
    \item The reader should understand that a main contribution is the abstract primitives that have been developed.
    \item The reader should understand that a main contribution is a open source tool.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A software tool of limited scope has been developed.
    \item The abstractions and concretizations from a Galios connection
    \item The analysis is show to be sound.
    \item The usability of the system is discussed but not tested with rigor. 
\end{itemize}
