\section{theory}\label{sec:theory}
In this section we will present the main contribution of the paper:
First we present the abstract syntax of the programs that the analysis is defined for, further we define the conversion from program to program graph and give the abstract syntax for instructions appearing on the edges within such graphs.
Next we formalize the abstract semantics, and thereafter we argue, through several proof sketches, that the abstract semantics are sound.
At last we prove that our analysis will always terminate.
