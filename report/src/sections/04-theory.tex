\section{theory}\label{theory}
The core theory behind this paper is based on abstract interpretation of a database and application, using lattice theory, serving as the foundation for analyzing the system.
This includes the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Abstract Domains, where the different domains of our model, such as strings and integers, will be explained.
    \item The Abstract Syntax and Semantics, where the abstract syntax is described and the abstract semantics is explained.
    \item Abstraction and Concretization describe how the abstractions relate to their concrete counterparts.
    \item Finally, the Model Overview will show the system model used in the paper.
\end{itemize}

Through this, we establish the theoretical framework for analyzing an abstract interpretation of a database and application.
