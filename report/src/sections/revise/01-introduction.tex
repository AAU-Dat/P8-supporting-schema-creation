\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Abstract interpretation, first proposed by Cousot and Cousot in 1977~\cite{cousot_abstract_1977}, has emerged as a fundamental method for static program analysis.
Over the years, it has evolved into a versatile tool, finding applications across various programming paradigms and system architectures.
Its utility extends beyond traditional imperative programming to encompass object-oriented designs and concurrent systems~\cite{gustafsson_analyzing_2013, mine_static_2023}.
Abstract interpretation has played a pivotal role in analyzing a spectrum of program properties, from basic safety and liveness concerns to intricate security considerations~\cite{mastroeni_abstract_2011}.

Use Halder concretely for abstract interpretation

Improve on the levels of abstraction, i.e., add not just abstract values but also abstract tuples

Describe an implementable algorithm for performing static analysis targeting specific properties, given a program and database.

Prove soundness for the analysis.

Describe the properties we wish to check using LTL-like encodings, i.e., phrases like \emph{always, eventually,} and \emph{never}, to describe undesirable database states.
