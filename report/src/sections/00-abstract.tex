    \begin{abstract}
        This paper presents an alternative to the framework presented in abstract interpretation applied to SQL, aiming to overcome a possible non-termination problem in Halder and Cortesi's work.
        Our alternative is a complete static dataflow analysis developed in the abstract interpretation framework.
        Our method resolves this non-termination issue by extending the abstraction of tables to the multiplicity of tuples.
        Additionally, we introduce new abstractions of the values using regular expressions for strings and union intervals for integers, as initially proposed by Cousot.
        Our analysis is informally proven to be sound and terminate reliably, providing a solid foundation for future research.
