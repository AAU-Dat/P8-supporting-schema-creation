    \begin{abstract}
        \textbf{Number unos:}
        Halder and Cortesi et al. proposed using abstract interpretation to represent database flows. Their article
        describes using soundness to guarantee states that a database cannot come in. However, the abstract interpretation does not consider termination, hindering the usability of the analysis.

        This paper addresses this problem by proposing a smaller abstract interpretation that can terminate.
        We proceed by providing the abstract syntax of how the analysis should be written with semantics. Last, we provide formal proof that the analysis is indeed sound.
        \textbf{Number dos:}
        Halder and Cortesi et al. proposed using abstract interpretation to represent database flows. Their approach utilizes soundness to ensure certain database states are unreachable. However, their abstract interpretation does not account for termination, limiting the usability of the analysis.
        This paper addresses this issue by proposing a more refined abstract interpretation that ensures termination. We provide the abstract syntax and semantics for implementing this analysis. Finally, we present a formal proof demonstrating the soundness of our proposed method.
