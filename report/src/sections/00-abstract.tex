    \begin{abstract}
        This paper presents an extension of abstract interpretation applied to SQL, aiming to overcome the non-termination problem in Halder and Cortesi's work.
        Our method resolves this non-termination issue by introducing additional abstractions for both tuples and values.
        Additionally, we introduce new abstractions of the values using regular expressions for strings and intervals for integers, which we have seen mentioned by Cousot but have yet to find any papers on or implementations for.
        Our framework is informally proven to be sound and terminate reliably, providing a solid foundation for future research.
