This section will discuss the results of the analysis and the implications of the results.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Problems in the work
    \item Limitations of the work
    \item Discussion of the results
    \item How these results can be understood or used
\end{itemize}


%Cortesi and Halder is hard to read, almost as if they make it harder to understand than needed. Their way cannot terminate.
%SQL was not they best use, as it has many implementation features that are different for platforms, therefore we might want to have used a more abstract language.
\subsection{Summary of results}
Through out the paper, it was originally planned to have a working experiment with the system. However, due to time constraints and the complexity of the research it was deemed neccesary to move the experiment to future work.
Due to this there are no actual results to discuss, however it is still possible to discuss the implications of the results that could have been found.


\subsection{Problems in the work}
Through the process of this paper, many issues occured with the analysis of the system. Such as defining the mathematics used and which paper to use as a foundation for the analysis. Unfortunately the paper chosen was not the best choice, as it proved to be hard to understand and the mathematics used made it so the implementation of the system would not terminate.
Moreover the choice of SQL as the language for the implementation was not the best choice, as it has many implementation features that are different, platform to platform. Therefore it might have been better to use a more abstract language.
