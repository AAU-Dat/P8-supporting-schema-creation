## Agenda

- **Objective**
    - The objective is to present the current progress and access the proposed solutions.
- **Can we talk exam plan? Daniel is going to Peru in June, and it would be nice to plan when the project exam is so he doesn't have to miss it.**
    - Lead: Daniel
- **Can you read and comment on introduction and related works, is there something missing and is it clear what we are trying to do? **
    - Lead: Sebastian
    - Preparation: Read section I introduction and II related works of the paper.
- **Is the direction that we are progressing with the proofs and the theory correct?**
    - Lead: Oliver
- **Does there exist any proofs for some of these theorems already or do you know some solid ways of proving  some of the not yet proven theorems?**
    - Lead: Oliver
    - Preparation: Read section V theory of of the paper.
- **The theory section at this point is just a collection of notes, when reading it does any questions arise?**
    - Lead: Casper
    - Preparation: Read section V theory of the paper.

## Status

The status of the project is a follows:
- We have a clear direction for defining the analysis:
    - Define the abstract semantics (we expect to be able to reuse a lot of Halder and Cortesi work)
        - We still need to define:
            - Abstract semantics for boolean formulas
            - Abstract semantics for arithmetic formulas
            - Abstract semantics for string formulas
    - Prove that the abstract semantic functions are monotone (Not done by Halder and Cortesi)
    - Prove that the abstract semantics are sound (We expect to be able to reuse ...)
- We have a 'framework' established for the implementation, and Sebastian is working on getting the testing framework on its feet.
