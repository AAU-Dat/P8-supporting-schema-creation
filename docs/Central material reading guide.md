## Introduction

This is a reading guide for the main material of this project.
The following material is supposed to be read in order.
All material can be found on the P8 Zotero.

## Abstract Interpretation in a Nutshell

*Website*

A simple explanation of the idea that we are employing, written by Cousot himself.

## Static Program Analysis

*Book/learning material*

Chapter 4 and 12 describes the central concepts of Lattice Theory and Abstract Interpretation pretty well, here under:
- Abstraction and Concretization functions
- Galois connection
- Soundness
- Optimality
- Completeness

## Formal Methods: An appetizer

*Book/learning material*

Chapter 4 describes Abstract Interpretation in a slightly different way that aligns better with what we are trying to do.

## Abstract interpretation

A short paper that gives a more abstract overview of abstract interpretation, and several ideas.
Also written by Cousot.

## Abstract interpretation: a unified lattice model for static analysis of programs by construction or approximation of fixpoints

The Seminal paper by Cousot (I Casper has not read the entirety of this paper.).
