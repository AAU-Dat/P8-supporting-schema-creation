- **General questions** (25 min)
    - Lead: Gabriela
    - Preparation: None
- **Do you see any issues with our MoSCoW prioritization?** (5 min)
    - Lead: Daniel
    - Preparation: Read MoSCow prioritization given below.
- **We have decided to include some description of the behavior of the domain as an input to the analysis, our current idea is to the describe the behaviour with a simple automata or transition system, but we have also considered sound workflow nets. Do you have any critique of this approach?** (10 min)
    - Lead: Casper/Sebastian
    - Preparation: See diagram of the system model below.
- **We have decided to cover string, reals and integers in our tool abstracting over the more specific types. In terms of abstract domains we are planning to use regular expressions for strings, and systems of linear (in)equalities for reals and integers. Do you have any critique of this approach?** (5 min)

- **We have written an outline of the introduction. Should anything be changed in the outline?** (5 min)
