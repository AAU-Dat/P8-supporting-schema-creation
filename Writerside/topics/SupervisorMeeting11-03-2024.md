Runge is missing
Gabriella is concerned about the goal of the tool
- The tool is not the only thing we need to contribute, we also need to include some research.
- We will only consider abstract values and not meta values. We pick the most abstract primitives, where we don't encounter computation issues.
We answer the questions that were in the current paper.
We already have some ideas for future work (CTL and LTL properties)
The restrictions we make should be thought out, and not just chosen due to time constraints.
We need to have other contributions than just the tool.
Give some examples of how the tools out put can be useful for a user.


We will look at code for next time
Moscow will be finalized
Interface will be chosen
Writing preliminaries will we started
